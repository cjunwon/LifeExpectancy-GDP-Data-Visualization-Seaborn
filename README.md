# LifeExpectancy-GDP-Data-Visualization-Seaborn
Basic data visualization practice with Seaborn (Life Expectancy &amp; GDP)

The project investigates the correlation between the economic output of a country and the life expectancy of its citizens.
The Jupyter notebook file demonstrates exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, and data visualization using the Seaborn package.

## Questions Explored:
* Has life expectancy increased over time in the six nations?
* Has GDP increased over time in the six nations?
* Is there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy of a country?
* What is the average life expectancy in these nations?
* What is the distribution of that life expectancy?

#### Data Sources:
* GDP Source: [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD "World Bank") national accounts data, and OECD National Accounts data files.
* Life expectancy Data Source: [World Health Organization](https://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.688 "World Health Organization")
